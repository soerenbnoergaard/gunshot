# gunshot

Convolution VST plugin.

## Requirements

- Cross platform (Windows, OSX, and Linux).
- Impulse response must be stored with the plugin state (not just a path to a file as this may move independently of the project).

## Status

- Looking into modufying the KlangFalter instead of starting from scratch.
